Etsy PHPUnit Extensions
=======================

[PHPUnit][phpunit] is the standard in testing PHP code. [Etsy][etsy] uses a lot of PHP and tests help us maintain quality while taking continuous deployment to the extreme.  We have encountered a few use cases here an there that let us work with PHPUnit better and faster, and we thought it would be awesome to share with everyone.
